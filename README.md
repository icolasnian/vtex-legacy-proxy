# VTEX Legacy Proxy

Extension made to proxy files from VTEX Stores.
Although its mostly useful for Legacy VTEX Stores, it can be used in IO Stores for proxying files such as checkout.css and checkout.js


## Functionalities

- Create stores to group your proxying rules
- Create rules for css and js files
- Indicates when a rule has been applied by changing extension icon
- Only applies rules if the replaced url exists, preventing errors with http / https prefixes (usually localhost varies for each project), therefore, if it isn't showing the active icon, its because your replaced url isn't a valid url.
